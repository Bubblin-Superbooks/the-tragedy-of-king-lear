<p>Kent. I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany<br>than Cornwall </p>
<p>Glou. It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of<br>thekingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most,<br>forequalities are so weigh&#39;d that curiosity in neither can makechoice of either&#39;s moiety</p>
<p>Kent. Is not this your son, my lord?  </p>
<p>Glou. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so<br>oftenblush&#39;d to acknowledge him that now I am braz&#39;d to&#39;t</p>
<p>Kent. I cannot conceive you</p>
<p>Glou. Sir, this young fellow&#39;s mother could; whereupon she grewround-womb&#39;d, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere<br>shehad a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?<br>Kent. I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being soproper</p>
<p>Glou. But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder<br>thanthis, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave<br>camesomething saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet<br>washis mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and thewhoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble<br>gentleman,Edmund?<br>Edm. [comes forward] No, my lord</p>

<p>Lear. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.Give me the map there. Know we have dividedIn three our kingdom; and &#39;tis our fast intentTo shake all cares and business from our age,Conferring them on younger strengths while weUnburthen&#39;d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,And you, our no less loving son of Albany,We have this hour a constant will to publishOur daughters&#39; several dowers, that future strifeMay be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,Great rivals in our youngest daughter&#39;s love,Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,And here are to be answer&#39;d. Tell me, my daughters(Since now we will divest us both of rule,Interest of territory, cares of state),Which of you shall we say doth love us most?That we our largest bounty may extendWhere nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,Our eldest-born, speak first</p>
<p>Gon. Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;As much as child e&#39;er lov&#39;d, or father found;A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.Beyond all manner of so much I love you</p>
<p>Cor. [aside] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent</p>
<p>Lear. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,With shadowy forests and with champains rich&#39;d,With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,We make thee lady. To thine and Albany&#39;s issueBe this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak</p>
<p>Reg. Sir, I am madeOf the selfsame metal that my sister is,And prize me at her worth. In my true heartI find she names my very deed of love;Only she comes too short, that I professMyself an enemy to all other joysWhich the most precious square of sense possesses,And find I am alone felicitateIn your dear Highness&#39; love</p>
<p>Cor. [aside] Then poor Cordelia!And yet not so; since I am sure my love&#39;sMore richer than my tongue</p>
<p>Lear. To thee and thine hereditary everRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom,No less in space, validity, and pleasureThan that conferr&#39;d on Goneril.- Now, our joy,Although the last, not least; to whose young loveThe vines of France and milk of BurgundyStrive to be interest; what can you say to drawA third more opulent than your sisters? Speak</p>
<p>Cor. Nothing, my lord</p>
<p>Lear. Nothing?<br>Cor. Nothing</p>
<p>Lear. Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again</p>
<p>Cor. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heaveMy heart into my mouth. I love your MajestyAccording to my bond; no more nor less</p>
<p>Lear. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,Lest it may mar your fortunes</p>
<p>Cor. Good my lord,You have begot me, bred me, lov&#39;d me; IReturn those duties back as are right fit,Obey you, love you, and most honour you.Why have my sisters husbands, if they sayThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carryHalf my love with him, half my care and duty.Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,To love my father all</p>
<p>Lear. But goes thy heart with this?<br>Cor. Ay, good my lord</p>
<p>Lear. So young, and so untender?<br>Cor. So young, my lord, and true</p>
<p>Lear. Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,The mysteries of Hecate and the night;By all the operation of the orbsFrom whom we do exist and cease to be;Here I disclaim all my paternal care,Propinquity and property of blood,And as a stranger to my heart and meHold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,Or he that makes his generation messesTo gorge his appetite, shall to my bosomBe as well neighbour&#39;d, pitied, and reliev&#39;d,As thou my sometime daughter</p>
<p>Kent. Good my liege-<br>Lear. Peace, Kent!Come not between the dragon and his wrath.I lov&#39;d her most, and thought to set my restOn her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-So be my grave my peace as here I giveHer father&#39;s heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,With my two daughters&#39; dowers digest this third;Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.I do invest you jointly in my power,Preeminence, and all the large effectsThat troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,With reservation of an hundred knights,By you to be sustain&#39;d, shall our abodeMake with you by due turns. Only we still retainThe name, and all th&#39; additions to a king. The sway,Revenue, execution of the rest,Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,This coronet part betwixt you</p>
<p>Kent. Royal Lear,Whom I have ever honour&#39;d as my king,Lov&#39;d as my father, as my master follow&#39;d,As my great patron thought on in my prayers-<br>Lear. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft</p>
<p>Kent. Let it fall rather, though the fork invadeThe region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerlyWhen Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?Think&#39;st thou that duty shall have dread to speakWhen power to flattery bows? To plainness honour&#39;s boundWhen majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom;And in thy best consideration checkThis hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,Nor are those empty-hearted whose low soundReverbs no hollowness</p>
<p>Lear. Kent, on thy life, no more!  
Kent. My life I never held but as a pawnTo wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,Thy safety being the motive</p>
<p>Lear. Out of my sight!  
Kent. See better, Lear, and let me still remainThe true blank of thine eye</p>
<p>Lear. Now by Apollo-<br>Kent. Now by Apollo, King,Thou swear&#39;st thy gods in vain</p>
<p>Lear. O vassal! miscreant!                              [Lays his hand on his sword.]<br>Alb., Corn. Dear sir, forbear!  
Kent. Do!Kill thy physician, and the fee bestowUpon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,I&#39;ll tell thee thou dost evil</p>
<p>Lear. Hear me, recreant!On thine allegiance, hear me!Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-Which we durst never yet- and with strain&#39;d prideTo come between our sentence and our power,-Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-Our potency made good, take thy reward.Five days we do allot thee for provisionTo shield thee from diseases of the world,And on the sixth to turn thy hated backUpon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,Thy banish&#39;d trunk be found in our dominions,The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,This shall not be revok&#39;d</p>
<p>Kent. Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear,Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.[To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee,<br>maid,That justly think&#39;st and hast most rightly said![To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your<br>deeds   approve,That good effects may spring from words of love.Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;He&#39;ll shape his old course in a country new</p>

<p>Attendants</p>
<p>Glou. Here&#39;s France and Burgundy, my noble lord</p>
<p>Lear. My Lord of Burgundy,We first address toward you, who with this kingHath rivall&#39;d for our daughter. What in the leastWill you require in present dower with her,Or cease your quest of love?<br>Bur. Most royal Majesty,I crave no more than hath your Highness offer&#39;d,Nor will you tender less</p>
<p>Lear. Right noble Burgundy,When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;But now her price is fall&#39;n. Sir, there she stands.If aught within that little seeming substance,Or all of it, with our displeasure piec&#39;d,And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,She&#39;s there, and she is yours</p>
<p>Bur. I know no answer</p>
<p>Lear. Will you, with those infirmities she owes,Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,Dow&#39;r&#39;d with our curse, and stranger&#39;d with our oath,Take her, or leave her?<br>Bur. Pardon me, royal sir.Election makes not up on such conditions</p>
<p>Lear. Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow&#39;r that made me,I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,I would not from your love make such a strayTo match you where I hate; therefore beseech youT&#39; avert your liking a more worthier wayThan on a wretch whom nature is asham&#39;dAlmost t&#39; acknowledge hers</p>
<p>France. This is most strange,That she that even but now was your best object,The argument of your praise, balm of your age,Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of timeCommit a thing so monstrous to dismantleSo many folds of favour. Sure her offenceMust be of such unnatural degreeThat monsters it, or your fore-vouch&#39;d affectionFall&#39;n into taint; which to believe of herMust be a faith that reason without miracleShould never plant in me</p>
<p>Cor. I yet beseech your Majesty,If for I want that glib and oily artTo speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,I&#39;ll do&#39;t before I speak- that you make knownIt is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,No unchaste action or dishonoured step,That hath depriv&#39;d me of your grace and favour;But even for want of that for which I am richer-A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongueAs I am glad I have not, though not to have itHath lost me in your liking</p>
<p>Lear. Better thouHadst not been born than not t&#39; have pleas&#39;d me better</p>
<p>France. Is it but this- a tardiness in natureWhich often leaves the history unspokeThat it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,What say you to the lady? Love&#39;s not loveWhen it is mingled with regards that standsAloof from th&#39; entire point. Will you have her?She is herself a dowry</p>
<p>Bur. Royal Lear,Give but that portion which yourself propos&#39;d,And here I take Cordelia by the hand,Duchess of Burgundy</p>
<p>Lear. Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm</p>
<p>Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a fatherThat you must lose a husband</p>
<p>Cor. Peace be with Burgundy!Since that respects of fortune are his love,I shall not be his wife</p>
<p>France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;Most choice, forsaken; and most lov&#39;d, despis&#39;d!Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.Be it lawful I take up what&#39;s cast away.Gods, gods! &#39;tis strange that from their cold&#39;st neglectMy love should kindle to inflam&#39;d respect.Thy dow&#39;rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.Not all the dukes in wat&#39;rish BurgundyCan buy this unpriz&#39;d precious maid of me.Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.Thou losest here, a better where to find</p>
<p>Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for weHave no such daughter, nor shall ever seeThat face of hers again. Therefore be goneWithout our grace, our love, our benison.Come, noble Burgundy.        </p>

<p>France. Bid farewell to your sisters</p>

Use well our father.To your professed bosoms I commit him;But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,I would prefer him to a better place!So farewell to you both</p>
<p>Gon. Prescribe not us our duties</p>
<p>Reg. Let your studyBe to content your lord, who hath receiv&#39;d youAt fortune&#39;s alms. You have obedience scanted,And well are worth the want that you have wanted</p>

<p>Gon. Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearlyappertains to us both. I think our father will hence<br>to-night</p>
<p>Reg. That&#39;s most certain, and with you; next month with us</p>
<p>Gon. You see how full of changes his age is. The observation wehave made of it hath not been little. He always lov&#39;d oursister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast<br>heroff appears too grossly</p>
<p>Reg. &#39;Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but<br>slenderlyknown himself</p>
<p>Gon. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; thenmust we look to receive from his age, not alone theimperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithalthe unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring<br>withthem</p>
<p>Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as<br>thisof Kent&#39;s banishment</p>
<p>Gon. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France<br>andhim. Pray you let&#39;s hit together. If our father carry<br>authoritywith such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of<br>hiswill but offend us</p>
<p>Reg. We shall further think on&#39;t</p>
<p>Gon. We must do something, and i&#39; th&#39; heat.                                                    </p>

<p>Hum! Conspiracy? &#39;Sleep till I wak&#39;d him, you should enjoy half his revenue.&#39; My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it? Edm. It was not brought me, my lord: there&#39;s the cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet. Glou. You know the character to be your brother&#39;s? Edm. If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not. Glou. It is his. Edm. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents. Glou. Hath he never before sounded you in this business? Edm. Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue. Glou. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I&#39;ll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he? Edm. I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger. Glou. Think you so? Edm. If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very evening. Glou. He cannot be such a monster. Edm. Nor is not, sure. Glou. To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution. Edm. I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal. Glou. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg&#39;d by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack&#39;d &#39;twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there&#39;s son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there&#39;s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish&#39;d! his offence, honesty! &#39;Tis strange. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exit. Edm. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc&#39;d obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon&#39;s Tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut!

I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily:<br>asof unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needlessdiffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,nuptial breaches, and I know not what</p>

<p>Lear. What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?<br>Kent.

<p>Lear. What&#39;s that?<br>Kent. Authority</p>
<p>Lear. What services canst thou do?<br>Kent. I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale<br>intelling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That whichordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of<br>meis diligence</p>
<p>Lear. How old art thou?<br>Kent. Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so<br>old todote on her for anything. I have years on my back<br>forty-eight</p>

Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;But that I told him the revenging gods&#39;Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;Spoke with how manifold and strong a bondThe child was bound to th&#39; father- sir, in fine,Seeing how loathly opposite I stoodTo his unnatural purpose, in fell motionWith his prepared sword he charges homeMy unprovided body, lanch&#39;d mine arm;But when he saw my best alarum&#39;d spirits,Bold in the quarrel&#39;s right, rous&#39;d to th&#39; encounter,Or whether gasted by the noise I made,Full suddenly he fled</p>

The noble Duke my master,My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night.By his authority I will proclaim itThat he which find, him shall deserve our thanks,Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;He that conceals him, death</p>
<p>Edm. When I dissuaded him from his intentAnd found him pight to do it, with curst speechI threaten&#39;d to discover him. He replied,&#39;Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,If I would stand against thee, would the reposalOf any trust, virtue, or worth in theeMake thy words faith&#39;d? No. What I should deny(As this I would; ay, though thou didst produceMy very character), I&#39;ld turn it allTo thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;And thou must make a dullard of the world,If they not thought the profits of my deathWere very pregnant and potential spursTo make thee seek it.&#39;<br>Glou. Strong and fast&#39;ned villain!Would he deny his letter? I never got him.                                             Tucket within.Hark, the Duke&#39;s trumpets! I know not why he comes.All ports I&#39;ll bar; the villain shall not scape;The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his pictureI will send far and near, that all the kingdomMay have due note of him, and of my land,Loyal and natural boy, I&#39;ll work the meansTo make thee capable</p>

Return with her?Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpterTo this detested groom. [Points at Oswald.]<br>Gon. At your choice, sir</p>
<p>Lear. I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.We&#39;ll no more meet, no more see one another.But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;Or rather a disease that&#39;s in my flesh,Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,A plague sore, an embossed carbuncleIn my corrupted blood. But I&#39;ll not chide thee.Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shootNor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,I and my hundred knights</p>
<p>Reg. Not altogether so.I look&#39;d not for you yet, nor am providedFor your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;For those that mingle reason with your passionMust be content to think you old, and so-But she knows what she does</p>
<p>Lear. Is this well spoken?<br>Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?Is it not well? What should you need of more?Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and dangerSpeak &#39;gainst so great a number? How in one houseShould many people, under two commands,Hold amity? &#39;Tis hard; almost impossible</p>
<p>Gon. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendanceFrom those that she calls servants, or from mine?<br>Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc&#39;d to slack ye,We could control them. If you will come to me(For now I spy a danger), I entreat youTo bring but five-and-twenty. To no moreWill I give place or notice</p>
<p>Lear. I gave you all-<br>Reg. And in good time you gave it!  
Lear. Made you my guardians, my depositaries;But kept a reservation to be followedWith such a number. What, must I come to youWith five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?<br>Reg. And speak&#39;t again my lord. No more with me</p>
<p>Lear. Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour&#39;dWhen others are more wicked; not being the worstStands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I&#39;ll go with<br>thee.Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,And thou art twice her love</p>
<p>Gon. Hear, me, my lord.What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,To follow in a house where twice so manyHave a command to tend you?<br>Reg. What need one?<br>Lear. O, reason not the need! Our basest beggarsAre in the poorest thing superfluous.Allow not nature more than nature needs,Man&#39;s life is cheap as beast&#39;s. Thou art a lady:If only to go warm were gorgeous,Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear&#39;stWhich scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,As full of grief as age; wretched in both.If it be you that stirs these daughters&#39; heartsAgainst their father, fool me not so muchTo bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,And let not women&#39;s weapons, water drops,Stain my man&#39;s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!I will have such revenges on you bothThat all the world shall- I will do such things-What they are yet, I know not; but they shall beThe terrors of the earth! You think I&#39;ll weep.No, I&#39;ll not weep.I have full cause of weeping, but this heartShall break into a hundred thousand flawsOr ere I&#39;ll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!         </p>

Wine lov&#39;d I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour&#39;d the Turk. False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.

Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by. Storm still. Lear. Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncover&#39;d body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou ow&#39;st the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here&#39;s three on&#39;s are sophisticated!

</blockquote>
<p>Glou. When shall I come to th&#39; top of that same hill?<br>Edg. You do climb up it now. Look how we labour</p>
<p>Glou. Methinks the ground is even</p>
<p>Edg. Horrible steep.Hark, do you hear the sea?<br>Glou. No, truly</p>
<p>Edg. Why, then, your other senses grow imperfectBy your eyes&#39; anguish</p>
<p>Glou. So may it be indeed.Methinks thy voice is alter&#39;d, and thou speak&#39;stIn better phrase and matter than thou didst</p>
<p>Edg. Y&#39;are much deceiv&#39;d. In nothing am I chang&#39;dBut in my garments</p>
<p>Glou. Methinks y&#39;are better spoken</p>
<p>Edg. Come on, sir; here&#39;s the place. Stand still. How fearfulAnd dizzy &#39;tis to cast one&#39;s eyes so low!The crows and choughs that wing the midway airShow scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway downHangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.The fishermen that walk upon the beachAppear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,Diminish&#39;d to her cock; her cock, a buoyAlmost too small for sight. The murmuring surgeThat on th&#39; unnumb&#39;red idle pebble chafesCannot be heard so high. I&#39;ll look no more,Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sightTopple down headlong</p>
<p>Glou. Set me where you stand</p>
<p>Edg. Give me your hand. You are now within a footOf th&#39; extreme verge. For all beneath the moonWould I not leap upright</p>
<p>Glou. Let go my hand.Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewelWell worth a poor man&#39;s taking. Fairies and godsProsper it with thee! Go thou further off;Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going</p>
<p>Edg. Now fare ye well, good sir</p>
<p>Glou. With all my heart</p>
<p>Edg. [aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despairIs done to cure it</p>
<p>Glou. O you mighty gods! He kneels.This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,Shake patiently my great affliction off.If I could bear it longer and not fallTo quarrel with your great opposeless wills,My snuff and loathed part of nature shouldBurn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!Now, fellow, fare thee well.                             He falls [forward and swoons]</p>
<p>Edg. Gone, sir, farewell.-And yet I know not how conceit may robThe treasury of life when life itselfYields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead?Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!-Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.What are you, sir?<br>Glou. Away, and let me die</p>
<p>Edg. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,So many fadom down precipitating,Thou&#39;dst shiver&#39;d like an egg; but thou dost breathe;Hast heavy substance; bleed&#39;st not; speak&#39;st; art sound.Ten masts at each make not the altitudeWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell.Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again</p>
<p>Glou. But have I fall&#39;n, or no?<br>Edg. From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg&#39;d lark so farCannot be seen or heard. Do but look up</p>
<p>Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!Is wretchedness depriv&#39;d that benefitTo end itself by death? &#39;Twas yet some comfortWhen misery could beguile the tyrant&#39;s rageAnd frustrate his proud will</p>
<p>Edg. Give me your arm.Up- so. How is&#39;t? Feel you your legs? You stand</p>
<p>Glou. Too well, too well</p>
<p>Edg. This is above all strangeness.Upon the crown o&#39; th&#39; cliff what thing was thatWhich parted from you?<br>Glou. A poor unfortunate beggar</p>
<p>Edg. As I stood here below, methought his eyesWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,Horns whelk&#39;d and wav&#39;d like the enridged sea.It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,Think that the clearest gods, who make them honoursOf men&#39;s impossibility, have preserv&#39;d thee</p>
<p>Glou. I do remember now. Henceforth I&#39;ll bearAffliction till it do cry out itself&#39;Enough, enough,&#39; and die. That thing you speak of,I took it for a man. Often &#39;twould say&#39;The fiend, the fiend&#39;- he led me to that place</p>

<p>Edg. Sweet marjoram</p>
<p>Lear. Pass</p>
<p>Glou. I know that voice</p>
<p>Lear. Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter&#39;d me like a<br>dog,and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black oneswere there. To say &#39;ay&#39; and &#39;no&#39; to everything I said! &#39;Ay&#39;<br>and&#39;no&#39; too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet meonce, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder<br>wouldnot peace at my bidding; there I found &#39;em, there I smelt<br>&#39;emout. Go to, they are not men o&#39; their words! They told me I<br>waseverything. &#39;Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof</p>
<p>Glou. The trick of that voice I do well remember.Is&#39;t not the King?<br>Lear. Ay, every inch a king!When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.I pardon that man&#39;s life. What was thy cause?Adultery?Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.The wren goes to&#39;t, and the small gilded flyDoes lecher in my sight.Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester&#39;s bastard sonWas kinder to his father than my daughtersGot &#39;tween the lawful sheets.To&#39;t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.Behold yond simp&#39;ring dame,Whose face between her forks presageth snow,That minces virtue, and does shake the headTo hear of pleasure&#39;s name.The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to&#39;tWith a more riotous appetite.Down from the waist they are Centaurs,Though women all above.But to the girdle do the gods inherit,Beneath is all the fiend&#39;s.There&#39;s hell, there&#39;s darkness, there&#39;s the sulphurous pit;burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah,<br>pah!Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten myimagination. There&#39;s money for thee</p>
<p>Glou. O, let me kiss that hand!  
Lear. Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality</p>
<p>Glou. O ruin&#39;d piece of nature! This great worldShall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?<br>Lear. I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at<br>me?No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I&#39;ll not love. Read thou thischallenge; mark but the penning of it</p>
<p>Glou. Were all the letters suns, I could not see one</p>
<p>Edg. [aside] I would not take this from report. It is,And my heart breaks at it</p>
<p>Lear. Read</p>
<p>Glou. What, with the case of eyes?<br>Lear. O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor<br>nomoney in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your<br>pursein a light. Yet you see how this world goes</p>
<p>Glou. I see it feelingly</p>
<p>Lear. What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no<br>eyes.Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yondsimple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and,<br>handy-dandy,which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen afarmer&#39;s dog bark at a beggar?<br>Glou. Ay, sir</p>
<p>Lear. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst<br>beholdthe great image of authority: a dog&#39;s obeyed in office.Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kindFor which thou whip&#39;st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.Through tatter&#39;d clothes small vices do appear;Robes and furr&#39;d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;Arm it in rags, a pygmy&#39;s straw does pierce it.None does offend, none- I say none! I&#39;ll able &#39;em.Take that of me, my friend, who have the powerTo seal th&#39; accuser&#39;s lips. Get thee glass eyesAnd, like a scurvy politician, seemTo see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So</p>
<p>Edg. O, matter and impertinency mix&#39;d!Reason, in madness!  
Lear. If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;Thou know&#39;st, the first time that we smell the airWe wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark</p>
<p>Glou. Alack, alack the day!  
Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are comeTo this great stage of fools. This&#39; a good block.It were a delicate stratagem to shoeA troop of horse with felt. I&#39;ll put&#39;t in proof,And when I have stol&#39;n upon these sons-in-law,Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!  </p>

With him I sent the Queen,My reason all the same; and they are readyTo-morrow, or at further space, t&#39; appearWhere you shall hold your session.

Say thou &#39;no,&#39;This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bentTo prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,Thou liest</p>
<p>Edm. In wisdom I should ask thy name;But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,What safe and nicely I might well delayBy rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;With the hell-hated lie o&#39;erwhelm thy heart;Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-This sword of mine shall give them instant wayWhere they shall rest for ever.
