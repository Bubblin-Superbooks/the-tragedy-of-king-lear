Come, let's away to prison.We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel downAnd ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laughAt gilded butterflies, and hear poor roguesTalk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out-And take upon 's the mystery of things,As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great onesThat ebb and flow by th' moon</p><p>Edm. Take them away</p><p>Lear. Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?He that parts us shall bring a brand from heavenAnd fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first.Come.</p></div> </div>
