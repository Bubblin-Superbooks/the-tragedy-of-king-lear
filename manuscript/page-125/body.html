Enter Lear and Fool</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Lear. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!You cataracts and hurricanoes, spoutTill you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,That makes ingrateful man!  
Fool. O nuncle, court</p></div> </div>
