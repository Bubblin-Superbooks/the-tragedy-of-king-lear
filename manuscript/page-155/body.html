<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">scarcely think our miseries our foes.Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind,Leaving free things and happy shows behind;But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskipWhen grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.How light and portable my pain seems now,When that which makes me bend makes the King bow,He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!Mark the high noises, and thyself bewrayWhen false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.What will hap more to-night, safe scape the King!Lurk, lurk.
