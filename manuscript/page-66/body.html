I am asham'dThat thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!Th' untented woundings of a father's cursePierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes,Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,And cast you, with the waters that you lose,To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter,Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.When she shall hear this of thee, with her nailsShe'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt findThat I'll resume the shape which thou dost thinkI have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.</p><blockquote class="  "><p>Exeunt</blockquote></div> </div>
