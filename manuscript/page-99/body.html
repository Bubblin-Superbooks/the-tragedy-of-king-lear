<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">voices,Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare armsPins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;And with this horrible object, from low farms,Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.</p><blockquote><p>Exit</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
