Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglectMy love should kindle to inflam'd respect.Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.Not all the dukes in wat'rish BurgundyCan buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.Thou losest here, a better where to find</p><p>Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for weHave no such daughter, nor shall ever seeThat face of hers again. Therefore be goneWithout our grace, our love, our benison.Come, noble Burgundy.</p></div> </div>
