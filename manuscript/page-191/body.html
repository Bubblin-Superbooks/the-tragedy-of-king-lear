How fearfulAnd dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!The crows and choughs that wing the midway airShow scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway downHangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.The fishermen that walk upon the beachAppear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoyAlmost too small for sight. The murmuring surgeThat on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafesCannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sightTopple down headlong</p><p>Glou. Set me where you stand</p><p>Edg. Give me your hand. You are now within a footOf th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moonWould I not leap upright</p></div> </div>
