<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">subject quakes.I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?Adultery?Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.The wren goes to't, and the small gilded flyDoes lecher in my sight.Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard sonWas kinder to his father than my daughtersGot 'tween the lawful sheets.To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.Behold yond simp'ring dame,Whose face between her forks presageth snow,That minces virtue, and does shake the headTo hear of pleasure's name.The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to'tWith a more riotous appetite.Down from the waist they are Centaurs,Though women all above.But to the girdle do the gods inherit,Beneath is all the fiend's.There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah,<br>pah!Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten myimagination. There's money for thee</p></div> </div>
