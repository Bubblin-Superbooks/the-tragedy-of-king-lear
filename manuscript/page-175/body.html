<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Alb. O Goneril,You are not worth the dust which the rude windBlows in your face! I fear your disposition.That nature which contemns it originCannot be bordered certain in itself.She that herself will sliver and disbranchFrom her material sap, perforce must witherAnd come to deadly use</p><p>Gon. No more! The text is foolish</p><p>Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?A father, and a gracious aged man,Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.Could my good brother suffer you to do it?A man, a prince, by him so benefited!If that the heavens do not their visible spiritsSend quickly down to tame these vile offences,It will come,Humanity must perforce prey on itself,Like monsters of the deep</p></div> </div>
