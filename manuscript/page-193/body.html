Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,So many fadom down precipitating,Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.Ten masts at each make not the altitudeWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell.Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again</p><p>Glou. But have I fall'n, or no?<br>Edg. From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so farCannot be seen or heard. Do but look up</p><p>Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefitTo end itself by death?
