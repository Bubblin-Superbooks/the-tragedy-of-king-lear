So 'tis to thee;But where the greater malady is fix'd,The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,The body's delicate. The tempest in my mindDoth from my senses take all feeling elseSave what beats there. Filial ingratitude!Is it not as this mouth should tear this handFor lifting food to't? But I will punish home!No, I will weep no more. In such a night'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!No more of that</p><p>Kent.
