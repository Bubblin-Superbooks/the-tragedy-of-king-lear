[rises] Never, Regan!She hath abated me of half my train;Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fallOn her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,You taking airs, with lameness!  
Corn. Fie, sir, fie!  
Lear. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flamesInto her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,To fall and blast her pride!  
Reg. O the blest gods! so will you wish on meWhen the rash mood is on</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Lear. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.Thy tender-hefted nature shall not giveThee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thineDo comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in theeTo grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,And, in conclusion, to oppose the boltAgainst my coming in. Thou better know'stThe offices of nature,</p></div> </div>
