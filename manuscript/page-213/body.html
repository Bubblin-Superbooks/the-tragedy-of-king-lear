Pray, do not mock me.I am a very foolish fond old man,Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;And, to deal plainly,I fear I am not in my perfect mind.Methinks I should know you, and know this man;Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorantWhat place this is; and all the skill I haveRemembers not these garments; nor I know notWhere I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;For (as I am a man I think this ladyTo be my child Cordelia)</p><p>Cor. And so I am! I am!  
Lear. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.If you have poison for me, I will drink it.I know you do not love me; for your sistersHave, as I do remember, done me wrong.You have some cause, they have not</p><p>Cor. No cause, no cause</p><p>Lear. Am I in France?<br>Kent. In your own kingdom, sir</p><p>Lear. Do not abuse me</p></div> </div>
